## Overview
### Description
Gamify learning like Khan Academy. Reward user with xp per article they've read. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Educational
- **Mobile:** This app will be completely mobile. All features are viable to develope for non-mobile devices. However developement for non-mobile devices seems unnecesary.
- **Story:** Provides users with random educational content, from which they will gain xp points the more they complete. The user will be able to level up the more xp they gain and will recieve "rewards" accordingly.
- **Market:** The market for this app is any and everyone intersted in a fun and interactive way of learning.
- **Habit:** Users can use this app as frequently as desired. Potential daily login bonuses as incentive to be more active.
- **Scope:** We would begin with an app that rewards user for reading articles and level up. Afterwards, we may develop a feature for them to play with friends.
